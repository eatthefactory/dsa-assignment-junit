# dsa-assignment-junit

Practical Exercise (10 points):

First, either fork the whole repository or get the source from https://github.com/matc-cs-chris/dsa-assignment-junit/blob/main/src/NumberInfo.java
  If you forked, create a project from your forked repository
    Make sure your fork is private, I don't want answers readily available to everyone for all years on the web
  Otherwise just create a new IntelliJ project and put this class in it
    Note: it needs to be in your source root folder
      usually called "src" but you can mark any folder your source root in intelliJ
Now, you'll add a dependency to JUnit to your project
  You can do this manually
  Or you can right-click create a test file for this class, it should add the dependency automatically
    This is described in the online documentation we read from JetBrains' IntelliJ website
  See the IntelliJ reading this week on how to do this
You will unit test this class with *coverage testing* using a class called "NumberInfoTest"
  These testing terms are defined in the textbook
Zip your project folder and email it to me
  You probably want to make a copy before zipping it
